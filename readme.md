# wmk â€“ a simple static site generator

## Getting ready

After cloning this repo into your chosen location (`$myrepo`), install the
necessary Python modules into a virtual environment:

```
cd $myrepo
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that, either put `$myrepo/bin` into your `$PATH` or create a symlink from
somewhere in your `$PATH` to `$myrepo/bin/wmk`.

Required software (aside from Python 3):

- `rsync` (for static file copying).
- For `wmk watch` functionality, you need to be on Linux and have `inotifywait`
  installed.

## Usage

The `wmk` command structure is `wmk <action> <base_directory>`. The base
directory is of course the directory containing the source files in
subdirectories such as `templates`, `content`, etc.  See below for details on
file organization.

- `wmk info $basedir`: Shows the real path to the location of `wmk.py` and of
  the content base directory. E.g. `wmk info .`.

- `wmk run $basedir`: Compiles/copies files into `$basedir/htdocs`.

- `wmk watch $basedir`: Watches for changes in the source directories inside
  `$basedir` and recompiles if changes are detected.

- `wmk serve $basedir`: Serves the files in `$basedir/htdocs` on
  `http://localhost:7007/`.

## File organization

Inside a given working directory, `wmk` assumes the following subdirectories for
content and output. They will be created if they do not exist:

- `htdocs`: The output directory. Rendered, processed or copied content is
  placed here, and `wmk serve` will serve files from this directory.

- `templates`: Mako templates. Templates with the extension `.mhtml` are
  rendered directly into `htdocs` as `.html` files, unless their filename starts
  with a dot or underscore or ends with `base.mhtml`.

- `content`: Markdown content with YAML metadata. This will be rendered into
  html using the `template` specified in the metadata or `md_base.mhtml` by
  default. The target filename will be `index.html` in a directory corresponding
  to the basename of the markdown file, unless `pretty_path` in the metadata is
  `false` (in which case only the extension is replaced). The converted content
  will be passed to the Mako template as the context variable `CONTENT`, along
  with other metadata. A YAML datasource can be specified in the metadata block
  as `LOAD`; the data in this file will be added to the context.

- `data`: YAML files for additional metadata.

- `assets`: Assets for an asset pipeline. Currently this only handles SCSS/Sass
  files in the subdirectory `scss`. They will be compiled to CSS which is placed
  in the target directory `htdocs/css`.

- `static`: Static files. Everything in here will be rsynced directoy over to
  `htdocs`.

## Notes

* The order of operations is as follows:

  1. Copy files from `static/`.
  2. Run asset pipeline.
  3. Render Mako templates from `templates`.
  4. Render Markdown content from `content`.

  Note that later steps may overwrite files placed by earlier steps.

* `wmk.py` uses timestamps to prevent unnecessary re-rendering of templates,
  markdown files and scss sources. The check is rather primitive so it may be
  necessary to touch the main source file or remove files from `htdocs` in order
  to trigger a refresh.

* If files are removed from source directories the corresponding files in
  `htdocs` will not disappear automatically. You have to clear them out
  manually.

## TODO

- Look for a file `$basedir/wmk_config.yaml` containing configuration variables.
  This would affect things such as markdown processing extensions, http port and
  additional template context variables.
